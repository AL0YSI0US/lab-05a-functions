# LAB - 5a Functions

## Git Branches

In this lab I was presented with five questions, each question had to be 
reponded to with code accurate enough to pass the prexisting test script
included within the assignment.

### Reflections and Comments

* On this lab I did not realize I should have left all of the test script 
enabled in my JavaScript. As I completed a problem I would comment out the 
previous test script. This was a habit developed from all the occurences of 
coding I have done previously.  

* I came back and finished the stretch goals via class led methodology.
